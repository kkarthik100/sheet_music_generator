# Sheet music generator

# What is it?

Are you an adult who just started learning classical music? Do you find it difficult to read sheet music? Do you find it even harder to read sheet music and at the same time move your hands and fingers to play the right notes? If so, this is for you.

Simply load the **index.html** in your browser and it will generate a full sheet of random notes. Take a printout of this page and practise with it. It will improve your sight reading skills, as random notes (unlike musical passss) force your eyes to pick up every note, since there is no pattern to them.

Even children can hugely improve their sight reading abilities using this tool.

# Technicals

The Javascript code appears inline within the **index.html** file itself. I didn't bother pulling the JS into its own separate file, as it is not too much of code.

# Improvements

You can get creative and add any number of ideas to this tool. For exacmple, you could provide options to generate random notes obeying a specific key signature or time signature. You can even specify the range of notes, which is a way to specify the "difficulty level". Using these (and many more) ideas, you can generate an entire book of random sheet music, with progressively increasing difficulty.
